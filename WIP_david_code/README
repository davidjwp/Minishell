for now i'm just trying to create the AbstractSyntaxTree

the only files that matter are in the parser folder
these files are :
-	create_ast2.c
-	lexerutilsA.c
-	lexerutilsB.c
-	lexerutilsC.c

the reason why i have so many other files is because i do tests or check things
and usually keep old code even if i'm pretty sure it's depreciated
